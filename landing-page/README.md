# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents
The Project has three files.
* index.html.
* style.css.
* app.js.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` to see the functionalities to run this app
First , We have four sections in this page .
Second , if we want to know the content of each section , you should click on the specified section, To Do this , i did function called (clickItem) to which section is clicked and make it active .
finally , If you want to scroll up , the section that appeared while scrolling , its name will be hightlighted in black color, for this I have used ("scroll event " & getBoundingClientRect() function to know the top of section).
I hope you to appreciate my work in this project.
